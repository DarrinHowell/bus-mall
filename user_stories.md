Research Team
1) As a research team member, I want to know which items our participants are most likely to click. (Which were the most popular?)

2) As a research team member, I want to see our data displayed in a way that is accessible and easy for us to understand. These results will inform how we enhance and improve our website. 

3) As a research team member, I want to ensure that our focus group members click through our web app 25 times to provide us with a uniform dataset. 

4) As a research team member, I want to know my focus-group results. By the end of this project, I want to know which items appeared, how many times they were voted for, and how often our participants voted for them as a ratio of times appeared / times clicked. 



Developer
1) As a developer, I want to construct an object that will contain all of the data and methods that will allow us to manipulate and visualize our images in HTML.

2) As a developer, I want to devise an algorithm tha will randomly select bus-mall merchandise from a list and randomly display three items, side-by-side-by side. 

3) As a developer, I want to ensure that these randomly displayed items do not duplicate while on a single page, and I want to ensure that items currently shown are not duplicates from the page that preceded the current one.

4) As a developer, I want to ensure that clicks on each item are counted and that the number of times that the number of times an item appears is reocrded. We want to ensure this across the 25 trials of our focus group. 

5) At this stage in development, we want to generate and display a list of all items, the number of times that they appeared, and the number of times that they were clicked. 


Focus Group Participants
1) As a focus group member, I want to see three items displayed side-by-side by side so I can choose which item out of the three I would want to purhcase.

2) As a focus group member, I want to walk through this selection / voting process fifteen times, seeing a new set of three items that do not duplicate nor repeat from the previous page. 

3) I want these images to be styled tastefully by the end of this project; I like working with things that are aesthetically pleasing. 

4) As a focus group participant, I wuold be interested in knowing which items were my favorites after the study is finished. Which items did I click most?
